# Blockchain-Legislative-Definitions-BLD-Project

**About**

The Blockchain Legislative Definitions (BLD) Project is a repository of legal definitions used by state authorities. Unlike a regulatory tracker of proposed legislation to regulate blockchain or cryptocurrency, BLD focuses on language definitions in legislation. Tracking legislation by itself is not enough if the language used in individual pieces of legislation is disjointed. By surfacing fragmented terminology, this repository provides a valuable resource for policymakers and academic researchers seeking insights into the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. By standardizing legislative language, the BRD contributes to more effective lawmaking.

The lack of standardized language in blockchain related laws underscores the challenges in understanding the full scope of relevant laws. The research process shed light on the challenge of fragmented data, data formats, and published materials. Difficulties included fragmented language, sparse legislation, ambiguity around new concepts, and information behind a paywall. These challenges, however, reinforce the BRDâ€™s repository as an accessible knowledge hub.

This repository provides a robust compilation of legislative information spanning various domains that includes finance, tax, privacy, and more. For government agencies and policymakers, the repository is a training tool. Users can analyze regulatory trends, identify gaps, and propose data-driven policy recommendations. It enables a deeper understanding of existing regulations, potential impacts, and best practices from other jurisdictions.

The Center hopes this repository advances knowledge sharing, fuels thoughtful discourse, and ultimately shapes a robust regulatory framework that unlocks the transformative potential of blockchain technology for social good.


**While this repository is updated regularly, it may not be comprehensive. None of the information provided is legal advice. The Center is only providing information and does not take advocacy positions to support any piece of legislation or proposed legislation.**
